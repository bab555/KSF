"""
Knowledge Injection Script for KSF V2

This script is a one-time utility to pre-load the KnowledgeBank module
with knowledge embeddings derived from an external text file.

It performs the following steps:
1. Loads the main KSF training configuration.
2. Initializes the full AdvancedKsfModel.
3. Retrieves the KnowledgeBank sub-module.
4. Calls the `inject_knowledge_from_file` method on the KnowledgeBank.
5. Saves the state dictionary of the modified KnowledgeBank to a file.

This pre-computed knowledge bank can then be loaded into the model before
starting the main training loop.
